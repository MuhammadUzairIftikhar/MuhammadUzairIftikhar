ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Muhammad Uzair Iftikhar, a passionate software engineering student currently in my 6th semester of BSSE. Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m gaining industry experience as a Core System Intern. I have a strong command over a diverse set of technologies including C++, C#, .NET, .NET Core, .NET Core Web API, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Docker, and more.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in microservices architecture and have hands-on experience with tools like MinIO, Kong, Grafana Loki, Rancher, and Hangfire. I enjoy solving complex problems and am always eager to learn new technologies. Let's connect and collaborate on innovative projects!
